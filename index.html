    Here is a challenge. 

    Sometimes youâ€™ve got to be bold. 
    
    Other times you might want to be more subtle. 
    
    My favorite topics: 
    
      I. C#
     II. .NET Core
    III. Root beer
    
    Things I may do tonight:
    
    Drink root beer;
    Stare at the wall;
    Take a very long walk.
    Maybe none of those.
    Maybe all of them!
    Drink more root beer.
